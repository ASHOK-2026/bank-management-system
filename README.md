## How to Run the Project

You can run this project using any C++ compiler or IDE that supports standard C++ and Windows libraries.

💡 I developed and tested this project using Code::Blocks.

You can simply copy the entire source code into your `main.cpp` file and compile/run it in your preferred C++ compiler.

After running the program:

First, navigate to **Bank Management** to create a new user.

To access the Bank Management section, use the following admin login credentials:

```
Email    : ashokpen2004@gmail.com
